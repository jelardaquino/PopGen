## Allele frequencies in a metapopulation

In population genetics, we often use diallelic models to analyze allele frequencies. In diallelic models, there are two alleles involved. For example, allele 'A' can represent black fur in rats, while allele 'a' represents white fur. In this tutorial, we will use diallelic models to model DNA sequences. Our genome has four possible nucleotides, A, T, C, and G. Because mutations are rare in most organisms, we typically tend to see at most two nucleotides involved in the individuals of a population. For example, Sickle Cell Anemia is caused by the substitution of A to a T. This tutorial will demonstrate how to simulate single nucleotide polymorphisms and calculate their [Allele Frequencies](PopGenExercise1.html) using R. Furthermore, a tutorial on how to estimate population differentiation, or [Calculating Fst](Fst/PopGenEx2.html).
